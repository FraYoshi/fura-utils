# Furayoshi scripts

these are a series of scripts I created to aid in unusual or repetitive tasks.

Sharing so also others could benefit from.

# Dependancies
- bash
- [parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software//parallel/parallel.html)

# How to
### Auto
Open a terminal on the fura-utils directory and then run:

`chmod +x INSTALL.sh && ./INSTALL.sh`

### Manual
Scripts must be made executable `chmod +x <file.sh>`

I suggest inserting these scripts in a bin directory like `~/bin` and add it to your PATH. This can be accomplished adding symbolic links of all the scripts like so:

open a terminal on the fura-utils directory and use
```
find "$(pwd -P)"/bin -type f -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x "{}" \; -exec ln -s "{}" </path/to/your/personal/bin/> \; && cp -r .config/furayoshi ~/.config/
```
replace `ln -s` with `cp` if you don't want symbolic links and remove `\;` at the end.

### Upgrades
unlink before every upgrade with
```
for script in <path/to/your/bin/*.sh>; do
	unlink $script;
done
```
or just delete the files.

# Uninstall
### Automatic
Open a terminal on the fura-utils directory and then run:

`chmod +x UNISTALL.sh && ./UNISTALL.sh`

### Manually
same as **Upgrades** but remove also from your PATH.

## Config file location

`~/.config/furayoshi/`

# Scripts explanation (wip)
## fura-video-hypercompress
It is a script to compress a #video to sub-mega sizes, which comes handy when used for previews or licensing where storage used is forever and expensive (like S3).

I personally use it to shasum and store into SafeCreative, where storage costs a lot, considering I'm gonna pay forever and more space = forever higher prices. (in case you are interested in SafeCreative, leave my 10% off: 9XZKH9)
